This is a solution to the [Skilled e-learning landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/skilled-elearning-landing-page-S1ObDrZ8q).

This project is a challenge of the two-page Mentor frontend site, where as one of the objectives was to leave the layout adaptable for all types of screen (responsive) and i also used Leaflet JS to create an interactive location map with custom location pin.

## What I learned

## CSS Variables

- I could make improvements for the first time using CSS variables.
  -Here's an adapted descriptio provided from chatGPT about this matter:

- CSS variables, also known as CSS custom properties, allow you to store and reuse values in your CSS code. They are a powerful tool that can help you improve your code readability and maintainability.

- Here's an example of how to define and use a CSS variable:
  ``
  :root {
  --primary-color: #666CA3;
  }

button {
background-color: var(--primary-color);
border-radius: 2.8rem;
padding: 1.67rem 2.8rem;
}
``

- In the example above, we first define a CSS variable called `--primary-color` with the value of `#666CA3` in the `:root` selector. Then, we use the `var()` function to reference the variable in the `background-color` property of the `button` selector.

- By using CSS variables, we can easily update the value of `--primary-color` in one place and it will be reflected in all the selectors that reference it.

- Overall, CSS variables provide a convenient way to manage and reuse values in your CSS code, making it more organized and maintainable.

## Notes on learning

- Next project ill start using what ive learnd from scss and try to improve my css positioning so i dont need to keep turning back and struggling with "imprudent paddings or margins"
